# Dictionary
This program is meant to demonstrate an understanding of dictionaries as a concept in coding. They are a list of objects that hold two values. A key and a value. Dictionaries are meant to allow the user to access the values through the use of the keys that they are associated with. Giving the user the ability to enter a key by using the **[]** operation and get the value associated with it.
# What to Expect
Understanding how dictionaries work is fairly simple. Though their applications can be versatile, allowing us to see what a dictionary holds in terms of its value or keys. Then allowing us to add or remove those elements and remove them in a way that allows us to access the value at the key that was removed. To fully understand what is being shown in this demonstration, we will walk through it step by step.
- A new dictionary is created.
- The items {1, a} and {2, c} are added to the list.
- The value of the item with the key 1 (a) is printed to the screen.
- The size of the list is revealed, this is useful later.
- The list then checks if it contains the key 1, if it does it prints that to the screen.
- Another check is made to see if the list contains the value 'a', if it does it prints that to the screen.
- The program removes an item with the key 2, and shows the value that was associated with the key.
- We then are shown the size of the list again, to contrast it with where we started.
